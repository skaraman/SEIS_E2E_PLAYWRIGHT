## Run Locally

Clone the project.
```bash
  git clone https://dev.azure.com/sjcodestack/SEIS_V2/_git/SEIS_E2E_PLAYWRIGHT
```
Go to the project directory.
```bash
  cd SEIS_E2E_PLAYWRIGHT
```
Build and Install dependencies.
```bash
  nvm use 16.13.0
  npm i
```
Run health checks.
```bash
  npm run e2e qa health-check
```

Here are example calls for your e2e.config.js script:
Note:
The order of flags (health-check, debug, workers) does not matter.
The environment (dev, qa, etc.) should be the first argument.
Default number of workers is 6 if not specified.

Example npm script calls
1. Default (dev environment, all tests except health-check)
```bash
  npm run e2e
```
2. Specify environment (e.g., qa)
```bash
  npm run e2e qa
```
3. Only health-check tests (dev environment)
```bash
  npm run e2e dev health-check
```
4. Only health-check tests (qa environment)
```bash
  npm run e2e qa health-check
```
5. Debug mode (headed browser, PWDEBUG=console, 1 worker)
```bash
  npm run e2e dev debug
```
6. Debug mode with health-check
```bash
  npm run e2e qa health-check debug
```
7. Specify number of workers (e.g., 4 workers)
```bash
  npm run e2e dev workers 4
```
8. Combine workers, health-check, and debug
```bash
  npm run e2e qa health-check debug workers 2
```
9. Run one set of specific tests (mark them @HD-Test-Debug)
```bash
  npm run e2e qa only-one
```
